# REFLECTION 😎
### This UTMDigital industrial visit offered me a great opportunity to have a view on a company working enviroment.
### Experiencing the real working environment enhanced my understanding of information systems and tech applications in organizational contexts. 
### It also broaden my horizons and allow me to connect what I learn in the course with real-world applications, making my studies more practical and meaningful.

# My Suggestion 🧑‍🏫
### The visit was a good experience for me, the only thing where it needs to be lengthened is the duration of the visit , we hope to get more time ⏳
