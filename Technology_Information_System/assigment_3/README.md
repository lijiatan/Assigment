# REFLECTION 😎
### This talk inspired me to think that knowledge is not something you learn for tests and forget. Instead, it should be applied and used to solve real-world problems.
### Next, the talk advises about the truth of success. 🧑‍🎓
### I believe each failure brings us one step closer to success. It’s better to try new things and make as many mistakes as I can before entering into society. 
### For example, I will try stepping into various fields in the computer science field.  
### Explore the difference and expand my overall knowledge in computer science. 
### Finally, I will decide which field is my favorite depending on the rewardless and happiness and dive deep into it. 
### Therefore, I would focus my efforts on my passion to become successful.

# My Suggestion 🧑‍🏫
### The talk is informative and meaningful, but the speaker tends to shift between topics, which makes it challenging to follow and grasp the main idea of the presentation. 🤯
### A clearer focus and smoother transitions between points might help the audience stay engaged and understand the core message better.
